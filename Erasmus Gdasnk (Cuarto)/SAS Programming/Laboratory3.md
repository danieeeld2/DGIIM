**Exercise 1.** Using data set sashelp.baseball create data set *mylib.players*, which contains name, team, league, position and salary. Then using *mylib.players* create table *mylib.national* players containing observations about players from national league. drop colum *league*.

For the first part we are going to use the clausule **keep** that specifies the names of the variables to the output data set. Then, we have:

```sas
LIBNAME mylib "/home/u63324691/soulutions";

data mylib.players;
	set sashelp.baseball;
	keep name team league position salary;
run;
```

Now, for the second part we are going to search players from the national league and then drop this value using the clausule **drop**. Then:

```sas
data mylib.national_players;
	set mylib.players;
	where league like "National";
	drop league;
run;
```

**Exercise 2.** In one data step create two data sets:

- *mylib.players_salaries* containing names and salaries of baseball players from th table *sashelp.baseball*.

- *mylib.players_teams* containing names and teams of baseball players from the table *sashelp.baseball*

```sas
data mylib.players_salaries(keep=name salary) mylib.players_teams(keep=name team);
	set sashelp.baseball;
run;
```

**Exercise 3.** Change names of variables in data set *mylib.players* to spanish.

```sas
data mylib.jugadores;
	set mylib.players;
	rename name=nombre team=equipo league=liga position=posicion salary=salario;
run;
```

**Exercise 4.**

1. Sort data set *sashelp.baseball* by Salary in ascending (default) order. Store the results in new data set *by_players_asc*. Who has the lowest salary?

```sas
proc sort data=sashelp.baseball out=mylib.by_players_asc;
	by salary;
run;
```

There are many players without salary. The first ont to have it is Robidoux, Billy Jo:

2. Sort data set *sashelp.baseball* by Salary in descending order. Store the results in new data set by_players_dsc. Who has the highest salary?

```sas
proc sort data=sashelp.baseball out=mylib.by_players_dsc;
	by descending salary;
run;
```

Murray has the highest salary.

**Exercise 5.** See how to use PROC SORT with keep and WHERE (as statement and as option). Using *sashelp.electric* create new data set *sorted_electric*, which will be sorted  ascending by variable *revenue* and descending by variable *customer*. The result should contain only variables *customer* and *revenue* and observations from the year 1999.

```sas
proc sort data=sashelp.electric(where=(year=1999)) out=mylib.sorted_electric(keep= revenue customer);
	by revenue descending customer;
run;
```

**Exercise 6.** Sort first 10 observations from data set *account* by variable *Town* without reapeating values of variable *Town*. Save results to the set *by_town10*. Save duplicates to the set *town_duplicates*.

```sas
data account;
INPUT Company $ 1-23 Debt 25-30 AccountNumber 33-36 Town $ 39-51;
/*1-22,25-30 etc - columns*/
